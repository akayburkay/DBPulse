# DBPulse
PostgreSQL Database Performance and Health App

DBPulse is a comprehensive desktop application designed to monitor the performance and overall health of PostgreSQL databases. 
It allows you to easily track query statistics, inspect database structures, and observe system resource usage ‚Äî all in real time.

üöÄ Features
Query performance statistics using pg_stat_statements

Database contents: tables, views, indexes

Disk usage, table sizes, and growth trends

Server status monitoring: CPU, memory, disk, active connections

Real-time monitoring with a user-friendly desktop interface

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements
For the application to function correctly, the pg_stat_statements extension must be enabled in the PostgreSQL configuration.

Make sure the following line exists in your postgresql.conf file:

shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
After making this change, restart the PostgreSQL service.

Then, run the following SQL command in the connected database:

CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
Without this extension, query performance statistics cannot be collected.
